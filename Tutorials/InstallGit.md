## Installing Git

Open up the `Terminal` application, and run the following command:

	git --version
	
If you have not yet installed Git, a prompt should be displayed asking to install it. Follow any directions from there.

## Alternative Methods

If you already have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, simply run the following command:

	brew install git

## Next Steps

Now that you have Git installed for work on local repositories, you are ready to [configure Git to use with Github](ConfigGit.md).
