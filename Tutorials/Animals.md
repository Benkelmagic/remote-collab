# Animals

The [Animals](../Projects/Animals.md) page is a repository of (adorable) animal images. We need to keep this repository up-to-date with the most important (adorable) animal images of our time.

This repository seeks to compile as many (adorable) images of as many different types of animals as possible. For each image, we will provide a small caption. If there are more than one instance of the given type of animal in the image, _italicize_ the [collective noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names).

In order to do our job, we will learn a couple tools:

- [Github](https://github.com)
- ([Github Flavored](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

## Prereqs

In order to complete this task, you'll need the following:

- A computer with a web browser (probably what you are using to read this document right now)
- A [Github account](Accounts.md)

## Prepare to Edit the Animals Doc

## Add a header

## Add an image

## Add a caption with styled text
