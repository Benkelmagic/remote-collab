# Animals

The [Animals](../Projects/Animals.md) page is a repository of (adorable) animal images. We need to keep this repository up-to-date with the most important (adorable) animal images of our time.

This repository seeks to compile as many (adorable) images of as many different types of animals as possible. For each image, we will provide a small caption. If there are more than one instance of the given type of animal in the image, _italicize_ the [collective noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names).

In order to do our job, we will learn a couple tools:

- [Github](https://github.com)
- ([Github Flavored](https://github.github.com/gfm/)) [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

2. [Add a Header](#add-a-header)
3. [Add an Image](#add-an-image)
4. [Add a Caption with Styled Text](#add-a-caption-with-styled-text)
5. [Add a Horizontal Rule (Divider)](#add-a-horizontal-rule-divider)

## Prereqs

In order to complete this task, you'll need the following:

- A computer with a web browser (probably what you are using to read this document right now)
- A [Github account](Accounts.md)

## Prepare to Edit the Animals Doc

Click on the pencil icon to the top-right of the [Animals](../Projects/Animals.md) document.

## Add a Header

If you are adding images of a type of animal which is not yet represented in the document, you will need to add a _header_ with the name of the animal.

In Markdown, you can specify the size of the header with varying amounts of `#` characters. For the types of animals, we are using the second-level header, so precede the type of animal with `##`.

For example, you can see that the `Penguins` header is encoded as `## Penguins`.

## Add an Image

The core mission of this document is to spread joy through (adorable) animal images. Thus, we need images.

In Markdown, you can an embed an image by using the following syntax:

	![Name of Image](link-to-image.com)
	
For example, the image of the waddle of penguins jumping looks like:

	![Waddle of penguins jumping](https://media.giphy.com/media/aYTf2pXrF8Sgo/giphy.gif)

## Add a Caption with Styled Text

Now that we have embded an image into your repository, we need to add a brief description of our image. If there is a group of animals of a given type in the image, we will _italicize_ the [collective noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animal_names).

In Markdown, normal text requires no fancy syntax: just write

## Add a Horizontal Rule (Divider)

If there are more than one image of a given type of animal, separate the images with a horizontal rule. In Markdown, it's as easy as typing the following:

	---
	
If there is only a single image of a given type of animal, don't worry about the divider!
